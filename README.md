# Project 1

**Title:** [Exploring Key Health Indicators Across Patients](https://github.com/ZubeiruBukari/ZubeiruBukari.github.io/blob/main/Health%20Insight.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning and Formatting, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers,Conditional Formatting, Timelines)

**Project Description:** This project focuses on analyzing patient health data to uncover relationships between lifestyle factors, medical history, and hospital length of stay. Using Excel’s analytical and visualization features, the dashboard provides an interactive overview of key health indicators across various medical conditions such as Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity, Cancer,Asthma, and Arthritis. The dashboard was designed to help healthcare analysts and decision-makers understand how factors such as stress, cholesterol, sleep duration, physical activity, and family history influence patient outcomes and hospitalization trends.

Dashboard Features:

Stress Level and Sleep Hours by Medical Condition: Bar chart comparing average stress and sleep hours across conditions.

Length of Stay by Medical Condition: Horizontal bar chart showing hospitalization duration by diagnosis.

Average Length of Stay by Medical Condition: Line chart illustrating variations in stay duration among different diseases.

Medical Condition by Family History: Pie chart highlighting the distribution of medical conditions based on family history presence.

Interactive Slicers: Filters to dynamically explore insights by medical condition, family history, and length of stay.

**Key findings:** Hypertension and Diabetes patients exhibited longer hospital stays compared to other conditions, indicating the chronic nature and management complexity of these diseases.

Higher stress levels were observed among patients with obesity and hypertension, suggesting a possible correlation between stress and lifestyle-related conditions.

Sleep duration varied significantly across medical conditions — patients with asthma and obesity tended to have fewer sleep hours on average.

Family history appeared to be a strong influencing factor for chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.

The relationship between physical activity and stress suggested that active individuals tended to report lower stress levels.

**Dashboard Overview:** This dashboard serves as a powerful analytical tool for visualizing patient health trends. It combines clinical data analysis and visual storytelling to identify critical health patterns and risk factors. The interactive design allows users to:

Monitor hospital length of stay for different diseases.

Compare lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep, and physical activity across patient groups.

Explore hereditary influences through family history segmentation.

Overall, this dashboard provides actionable insights that could inform healthcare management strategies, patient education programs, and wellness interventions.

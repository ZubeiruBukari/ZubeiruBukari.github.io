# Project 1

**Title:** [Exploring Key Health Indicators Across Patients](https://github.com/ZubeiruBukari/ZubeiruBukari.github.io/blob/main/Health%20Insight.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning and Formatting, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers,Conditional Formatting, Timelines)

**Project Description:** This project focuses on analyzing patient health data to uncover relationships between lifestyle factors, medical history, and hospital length of stay. Using Excel’s analytical and visualization features, the dashboard provides an interactive overview of key health indicators across various medical conditions such as Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity, Cancer,Asthma, and Arthritis. The dashboard was designed to help healthcare analysts and decision-makers understand how factors such as stress, cholesterol, sleep duration, physical activity, and family history influence patient outcomes and hospitalization trends.

Dashboard Features:

Stress Level and Sleep Hours by Medical Condition: Bar chart comparing average stress and sleep hours across conditions.

Length of Stay by Medical Condition: Horizontal bar chart showing hospitalization duration by diagnosis.

Average Length of Stay by Medical Condition: Line chart illustrating variations in stay duration among different diseases.

Medical Condition by Family History: Pie chart highlighting the distribution of medical conditions based on family history presence.

Interactive Slicers: Filters to dynamically explore insights by medical condition, family history, and length of stay.

**Key findings:** Hypertension and Diabetes patients exhibited longer hospital stays compared to other conditions, indicating the chronic nature and management complexity of these diseases.

Higher stress levels were observed among patients with obesity and hypertension, suggesting a possible correlation between stress and lifestyle-related conditions.

Sleep duration varied significantly across medical conditions — patients with asthma and obesity tended to have fewer sleep hours on average.

Family history appeared to be a strong influencing factor for chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.

The relationship between physical activity and stress suggested that active individuals tended to report lower stress levels.

**Dashboard Overview:** This dashboard serves as a powerful analytical tool for visualizing patient health trends. It combines clinical data analysis and visual storytelling to identify critical health patterns and risk factors. The interactive design allows users to:

Monitor hospital length of stay for different diseases.

Compare lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep, and physical activity across patient groups.

Explore hereditary influences through family history segmentation.

Overall, this dashboard provides actionable insights that could inform healthcare management strategies, patient education programs, and wellness interventions.

# Project 2

**Title:** Employee Data

**SQL Code:** [HR Database-SQL Codes](https://github.com/ZubeiruBukari/ZubeiruBukari.github.io/blob/main/Employee.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:** Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval

**Project Description:** This project demonstrates the design and analysis of an employee management system using SQL. The aim is to manage and analyze employee details and salary data through a relational database consisting of two tables — Employee_Details and Employee_Salary.

The Employee_Details table stores information such as employee ID, full name, manager ID, joining date, and city, while the Employee_Salary table contains data on project assignments, salary, and variable pay components.

Through a series of SQL queries, this project explores key HR and payroll insights, such as:

Identifying employees under a specific manager.

Fetching project distributions and participation counts.

Analyzing salary statistics (maximum, minimum, and average).

Filtering employees based on city, project type, and name patterns.

Performing calculations to derive total compensation per employee.

Combining data from multiple tables using JOIN operations to ensure integrated insights.

This project highlights how SQL can be used to effectively organize, query, and analyze workforce-related data, supporting informed decision-making in HR and business operations.

**Technology used:** SQL server

# Project 3

**Title:** Workplace Safety Data

**SQL Code:** [Workplace Database-SQL Codes](https://github.com/ZubeiruBukari/ZubeiruBukari.github.io/blob/main/Workplace_Safety.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:** Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval

**Project Description:** This project focuses on analyzing workplace safety data from multiple plants to uncover patterns and insights related to employee incidents, costs, and safety performance. Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), I explored the dataset systematically to identify critical factors such as the most common incident types, departments with the highest costs, and trends across time periods and demographics.

The dataset — Workplace Safety Data — contains information on various incidents, including the date, plant, department, report type, incident type, injury location, gender, age group, days lost, and incident cost. The goal of this analysis was to support data-driven decision-making in occupational health and safety management, helping organizations minimize risks, manage costs, and improve workplace safety culture.

Insights derived include:

Identify which plants and departments record the highest number of incidents.

Evaluate the total and average cost of incidents by category.

Analyze incident distribution by shift, gender, and age group.

Determine which incident types result in the highest days lost and cost.

Examine temporal trends by year and month to monitor safety performance.

Support proactive risk management and improve safety strategies based on data insights.
